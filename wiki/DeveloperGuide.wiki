= Developer Guide =

 * Make sure you have a Subversion Client (e.g. TortoiseSVN)
 * Get code from SVN by following the instructions at http://code.google.com/p/mismo-bindings/source
 * Make sure you have ANT 1.6 installed and in your path
 * Run "ant" from the new "mismo-bindings" directory where you downloaded the code. This compiles the code and produces JAR files in the "dist" subdirectory.
 * Open the project in your favorite IDE (Eclipse project files are included) and look at the sources under "modules" directory.
 * Try running some tests from one of the "test" directories.
 * If you still have questions, contact us at opensource@sysdelphia.com
